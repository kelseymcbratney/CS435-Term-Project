Unlike other thermos-type cups, this one actually keeps the beverage hot for quite some time, especially if you place the cap on it. The cap itself is really unique in the way it works. After filling with a hot liquid the cap fits rather loosely in place. But, after a few seconds heat expands it and it wedges itself in place very securely. You can still pry it off but not easily when it's hot which is just what you'd want. Also, that cap has a neat little sliding anti-splash tab on the top that actually works.\nThe cup is wide enough to be stable sitting on a flat surface - with or without liquid in it - yet fits easily into a car tray cup holder for travel.\nAfter using the cup for a few days I decided that I didn't want the nylon handle. I simply used a heat gun (on low) to gently heat it up and just pulled it down and off of the cup.\nThat handle is secured to the cup with some glue and a slight ridge running around its inner circumference.

Within 2 days of MAYBE 5 minutes per day of me explaining how the clock worked, he could tell time to the exact MINUTE and get it perfectly right every time!\n\nMy boy is CRAZY about gears and the fact that this clock has two internal gears showing through a clear window grabbed his eyes and riveted his attention the second he saw it. He immediately wrestled the clock from my hands to play with it. Since playing is learning, I let him have it. The hands are cleverly geared to where the hour hand will advance when the minute hand is turned but the hands are not \"locked\" so you can move the minute and hour hand to wherever you want them to be. This is VERY helpful when you are first teaching time. I could place the hour hand EXACTLY on 12 and the minute hand EXACTLY on the 6 to help him identify 12:30. With other clocks the hour & minute hands lock so when the minute hand is on the half hour, the hour hand is between the 12 and 1 and it won't let you move it forwards or back. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that this clock does not lock like that and lets me move the hands completely independently or in tandem as I choose! Sure, he can see that when he moves the minute hand, the hour progresses on its own towards the next hour number and NOW he understands how to read a clock when the hour hand is halfway between two numbers but before he was confused by the hand being between the 12 and 1 and would guess at the time (sixty o'five?)\n\nAnother thing I love about this clock is that around the outside edge of the numbers is a blue painted \"gear\" circle shape (shown as a green outer ring in the preview) that has the five minute increments written beside every number and the \"teeth\" of the gear mark the individual minutes in between each 5 minute number. He latched on to the gear concept instantly so explaining to him that each gear tooth represented one minute made learning to tell time a SNAP. Literally, I explained the very basics and as he played with the clock, he got it. Easiest thing I have EVER taught him thanks to this little Judy clock!\n\nIf you feel like maybe you can't put your understanding of telling time into words, don't worry! The little booklet that comes with the clock gives you step-by-step teaching sentences you can repeat to your child and even covers what 'quarter hour' means. The booklet is about 5x7 inches with some small coloring pages, a few short question worksheets and time telling challenges, etc. I started to use the booklet and got to the part about where I explain quarter hours (the clock is like a pizza and you can slice the time into 4 equal parts of 15 minutes each) and my son was hushing me up because he suddenly understood telling time and wanted to make the clock read the same time as our digital microwave clock. This was in the first five minutes of the thing being in his hands and he did it!\n\nIf you have a child who is a tactile-kinesthetic learner, has had difficulty telling time or you just want to make homework a million times easier, get this clock! (And I suggest this style - 'My Own Little Judy Clock' that has non-locking hands). Confusing homework sheets with bland black-and-white clock images become soooo much easier to understand when your child can hold a clock, move the hands around, count by fives along the outer minute rim or count the individual teeth if necessary to answer math questions. If only all of teaching was this easy!\n\nClock is yellow plastic with plastic hands and internal gears. It isn't flimsy but could crack if stepped on. Hands are not brittle and have some give to them, which is nice because they get much more handling. 5 inches tall by 5 inches wide with little plastic easel stand in the back for upright display. Black printed numbers with a blue printed outer minute ring. Red & green internal wheels behind clear plastic window.", "summary": "AWESOME Little Clock - Kindergartener Telling Time In 2 Days!", "unixReviewTime": 1371686400}

The operation and construction is identical:\n\nI read books at night, frequently, so I purchased this product so I wouldn't disturb my wife.  This light source is simple in design:  tiny LED lamps illuminate a thin piece of plastic (working similar to a fiberoptic lamp&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lumisource-LS-FO-SPRAY-Fiber-Optic-Spray/dp/B001DI7BO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lumisource LS-FO SPRAY Fiber Optic Spray</a>).  It is about the dimensions of a full sized book and the black handle which houses the battery/light source is somewhat bulky.  A small button toggles the light intensity from low to dim to off.\n\nUSE\n\nPlace the item on the page that you want to read, push the button to the light intensity that you desire (allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness, which may take a minute or more), and flip the item to the other page to read.  As you turn the page, you will need to take the item out, and place it back into the book.\n\nIn concept, this product is ideal.  You have a light source that is limited to the pages that you are viewing.  However, even on the highest intensity (let's call it dim and dimmer), the light is still somewhat low.  What can you read with this item?  Books that have high contrast paper (glossy pages are most ideal since the reflective proper of the paper allows for better view).  Conventional novels are a bit more difficult to read.  Magazines are impossible unless you read on your stomach with the magazine placed on the bed.  Furthermore, pictures are difficult to see, at best.\n\nDURABILITY\n\nLike any screen on a laptop, I placed a SCREEN PROTECTOR on my lightwedge to prevent scratches.  Any scratch with transmit uneven light (more than usual).\n\nGiven that LEDs have very little power requirements, I have had the same batteries in the unit for the past 3 years, and it is still running.\n\nDESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nMore LED bulbs along the 'spine' of the handle would improve the light intensity.\n\nA thinner, scratch resistant plastic with a lighter handle would be a marked improvement.\n\nVERDICT\n\nKnowing the limitations and tendency for scratches, it is an innovative product that still has good uses.

That said, it includes ideas for cookie pops, brownie pops and cake pops.  Though there is a section which covers making cake pop dough and different sizes of round pops, this book doesn't cover different flavors, different shapes (except pushing the dough through a tube) and decorating elements like candy, sprinkles, pretzels, etc. are not covered much at all. What is covered are cookie pops and brownie pops molded in Wilton molds, dipping pops into candy melted in a Wilton candy pro melting pot (microwaving not covered), pops dried in Wilton pop decorating stand (styrofoam not mentioned) and decorating using primarily Wilton candy sprinkles of all kinds and a lot of Wilton pre-rolled and tinted fondant.  Almost all the pops are round or molded in a Wilton mold. They also neglect to mention using a cookie scoop, a great way to get your cake pops all the same size.\n\nDon't get me wrong, many of the pops are gorgeous and I will definitely be using some of the techniques, even the ones using fondant, but it is unlikely a beginner will be able to make these pops the first time.  Instead, buy Bakerella's book, which isn't perfect, but is better for beginners and has photos of the decorating elements, makes different shaped pops, talks about candy temperature and cake pop temperature.  It will at least give beginners a fighting change to make a recognizable pop the first time.\n\nBuy this book for ideas, after you buy Bakerella's book and view her website to learn to make cake pops.", "summary": "Idea magazine, NOT a how to make cake pop book", "unixReviewTime": 1299369600}

I think I like my five favorite songs from The Eminem Show better than my five favorite from MMLP, but I think MMLP is better top to bottom.  There are a few songs on The Eminem Show (Drips, Solider, Cleanin' Out My Closet, Saying Goodbye to Hollywood) that are entirely skippable, and you just don't have that on the MMLP.\n\nI would highlight the Sing for the Moment track as a standout as I believe it is the first time that Em used a classic rock track as the foundation of a song, an awesome trend he would continue in the future. The beat for Superman is just spectacular, matching Em's disgusted lyrics and delivery perfectly.

Listened to it in my truck on an hour drive (which wasn't long enough to listen in one sitting). I listen to all kinds of music...opera, rock, country. I don't dislike rap but I don't listen to it very much. Got this from the library and thought I would give it a try. I can understand why he is liked so much. Great beat...could hardly stop bobbing my head. I listened to it while driving...windows down...bass beating. Felt like a gangsta! The lyrics can certainly offend many people but I took it as a history lesson of what young people are up too. I think the guy is a genius. The amazing speed that he can spit out sentences is astounding. Really forces you to focus on what he is saying. Every song on this CD is different but they all have the entrancing beat. The song, \"Cleaning out my Closet\" is really touching and sad. Sure this is all explicit. But banning his music is like burning Beatle records or not allowing Elvis to move his hips on TV. Every generation has somebody that they try to stop from getting messages to the young folk. It is his story and he is telling it his way. I've met people who think they shouldn't cuss on war shows...that they don't need it. It is because of that, that people think war is gallant and heroic (which sometimes it can be). Instead they need to be showing people screaming, cussing when their leg is blown off - that is real. Why would you want to edit it? Eminem is telling his story his way. It is his emotions pouring out in his song. If you don't like it then don't buy it. Don't ban it. This is a really good album. I just listened to it again yesterday whilst walking. I was able to really concentrate on the lyrics. Give it a chance older folks! To me this is every bit as classic \"album\" as Dark Side of the Moon, Days of Future Passed and Take Five.

From thought provoking yet playful lyrics to slick beats that lace his determined delivery, this album has rarely a dull moment.  Sure, it contains one of his single worst songs (`Drips'), but it also contains a slew of his best.\n\nThe album opens with a string of strength, starting with `White America'.  The song is targeted at, but not limited to, the political embarrassments that surrounded our country around the time the album was dropped.  With a fiery delivery that shows true passion for his themes, Eminem defies the stigma that surrounds the genre and shows that he has logical teeth behind his words (he's shown that before, but it's always nice to be reminded).  `Business' follows with a funky beat that gives Eminem a nice backdrop for his clownish lyrics.  It's not the best track on the album, and it's certainly not the best of Eminem's playful tracks, but it kind of gets everything right.  `Cleanin' Out My Closet' brings us back to a more serious place, delivering one of Eminem's best tracks to date.  Eminem takes us back to his childhood and uncovers more about his turbulent relationship with his mother.  The picture he paints is grim, yet it is lathered with pure style.  `Square Dance' jumps back to a more playful tone (yet it certainly retains a more serious edge with its lyrical content) and it does so flawlessly.  This one has always been one of my favorites on the album.  The beat is sick and the rhymes are tightly structured around the infectious beat.\n\nAnd then you have `Soldier', which is like one of the best rap songs of the decade.  The track is perfect, containing one of the best beats on the album and the way Eminem struts his swagger, slinging verbal assaults like it was dirt in your eye; it just all screams authentic angst which helps sell this as one of the more poignant tracks on the album.  The anger here is perfectly situated to elevate the track into something so dark it feels raw and real.  Unlike the times when Eminem tries to make his murderistic (yes I made that word up for this review) rampages seem playful or humorous, Eminem shrugs humor to the side and delivers something unlike him yet completely comfortable.\n\nHe's far more than just a one-trick pony.\n\nReminiscent of his previous releases, there is that one track that became his first single and gathered him boatloads of attention once again; this time it was `Without Me'.  The track is hilarious and fun and certainly in line with `The Real Slim Shady' and `My Name Is'.  I actually prefer `Superman', which is a hilarious parody of all those ridiculously perverse love songs that circulate the airwaves.\n\nThe later half of the album contains a few tracks that really deserve to be singled out.  `Sing for the Moment' is one of Eminem's better tracks to use samples.  The Aerosmith sampling is perfectly suited for the song and it elevates Eminem's message.  `When the Music Stops' is insanely fierce from start to finish.  `Till I Collapse' is also very strong, and Nate Dogg's chorus lines give the song an almost vintage feel.  I love his voice and the way he lends a touch of class to every track he inhabits.  `My Dad's Gone Crazy' is a great way to close out the album.  Having Hallie on the track seems a tad odd, especially when you consider the things he says in this song, but it's a playful song that is slathered with humor, so don't take this track too seriously.\n\nIt's just fun.\n\n`Say Goodbye to Hollywood' and `Hallie's Song' have their moments, but they don't quite get it completely.  Still, they are nice additions and don't feel like filler here.  In fact, the only track I didn't really care for (outside of the abomination that was `Drips') was `Say What U Say', Eminem's collaboration with Dr. Dre.  It just lacks the real spark that comes from Shady's music.  It felt like a rejected Dre track, not a refurbished Eminem track.\n\nAlas, the album as a whole is close to genius.  He proves here that despite his vulgar use of words deemed inappropriate, he cannot be defined by his controversial take on life.  By toning himself down here, Eminem shows us that there is a great deal of talent behind those offensive slurs, developing an album reflective of where he was in his rise to fame.  I love that he is back in the game, and I can't wait to see where he goes now.  If he can top this album then we'll be looking at one of the greatest rappers to ever set foot in the game, but then again, I think he's already achieved that title.", "summary": "The last great Eminem album...", "unixReviewTime": 1281916800}

His absence on the music scene, despite how you might feel about him, is noticeable. His music is singular, even in such a prolific field as Rap is and even with as many people that are on his CD, whether as a performer, a producer or a mixer. Historically, the people that have walked in his shoes never faired very well, whether it was through continued success or respect amongst fans or becoming a sell-out. I don't think Slim has to worry about the last one at all as he's struggled continuously to stay relevant and fresh.\n\nThe Eminem show may not be the fan favourite, and it may even have a few low moments that fans would rather do without, but this album is like a snapshot of the artists life in full-color, or stereo. It's a very complex and sometimes moving memoir on his life in song. A lot of other recording artists would be so lucky to have been able to achieve something this powerful so early in their career. In fact, unfortunately, most musicians never do. Good 'concept albums' are few and far between.\n\nThe story of a young man trying to get up out of the hood, is one that's familiar with a lot of people. The struggle is real and that's probably why his music has resonated with so many folks from all corners of the world.\n\nRap music may have gone through an epiphanous phase during the mid nineties through to ot-five. Slim coming in during the beginning and making it all the way through to the end without plastic surgery, heavy jail time or an over-dose. He may have made it through some dark times in order to tell us about it all years from now.\n\nThis is an album that absolutely must be listened to as it encapsulates the last decade very well.\n\n... ...", "summary": "It's hard being young, from the slums, eatin' five cent gums, not knowing where your next meal is coming from ...", "unixReviewTime": 1225065600}

Eminem is THE best rapper out there, with great beats, funny lyrics and terrific production.  The songs are very personal, and my favorites are: White America, Square Dance, Without Me and Hailie's Song.\n\nEminem has had a tough life. So have a lot of people. But what makes him inspirational is that instead of wallowing in victimhood, he worked hard, he didn't give up and he found his voice. I admire this artist for channeling his anger into something creative. Furthermore, even as he criticizes his mother, he says \"I'm sorry, mama, I never meant to hurt you\" -- this to a woman who was too busy fighting her own demons to be a mother to her talented and intelligent son. (Couldn't she PLEASE just tell him that she screwed up and she's sorry?) Another emotion that comes through, over and over, is his love for his daughter. What's not admirable about that? Also, I don't see half-naked women writhing in Eminem videos. I see intelligence and humor, and this is what I really love about Marshall Mathers. He is very very funny, and more power to him for taking his pain and his anger and creating humor and art. It's easy to perpetuate wickedness, tough to end the cycle of bad parenting and violence, but he seems to be trying.\n\nWhile I can't speak for all librarians, as a group we're against censorship, and I believe that you should never let anyone tell you what to think about music -- or literature or politics or how to run your life, for that matter.

Slim Shady's third album, \"The Eminem Show\" proves once and for all that Mr. Mathers is extremely talented, in addition to being a lightning rod for controversy.  With his debut album in 1999, \"The Slim Shady LP\", it would easy to have written him off as another white rapper being a pretender to the throne of hip-hop greatness.  Even with catchy songs like \"My Name is\" and \"Guilty Conscience\" making loud noise on the Top-40 charts, critics were in a hurry to lump him with other 'Great White Hopes' that flamed out like Vanilla Ice (just a complete joke) and Snow (just never found an audience).  The success of his sophomore album, \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" shocked many and showed he had staying power, but the truth is, Eminem was destined for success from the start.\n\n  First, Eminem is a gifted lyricist and free-stylist, which already separates him from the pre-fabricated hip-hop garbage like Ja Rule and such.  Second, he made the crucial decision early on to ally himself with arguably the most respected and skillful name in the hip-hop world, Dr. Dre.  With Dre's expert and ORIGINAL sound backing up Shady's vocals, it was inevitable that he would be successful and that eventually people would come around to realize his talent.\n\n  \"The Eminem Show\" continues to show the evolution of that talent.  \"Without Me\" captures the same fast-paced, light-hearted slams at popular culture that \"The Real Slim Shady\" did on his previous album.  In addition to such 'amusing' songs like that and \"White America\", Eminem delves deeper into, and makes some peace with, his sordid past.  \"Cleaning Out My Closet\" goes right to the heart of his pain about his upbringing and his fractured relationship with his mother.  If his lyrics in this song are indeed and accurate depiction of his life growing up, then it's no wonder he's such an angry individual.  Yet, through that anger, he seems to be making peace with himself, even if it means terminating any relationship with his mother.  It's gritty, harsh, but real material.\n\n  Eminem is branching out into movies now with a loosely autobiographical \"8 Mile\".  Early reviews there seem positive, too.  It's always fascinating to see what he will produce next.  The controversy he generates grabs people's attention the first time.

In the context of the stage show - look at the cover:  MM on stage in front of a closed curtain; now you see him, now you don't - this album is an a report from the field, so to speak, of the evolving Slim Shady/Marshall Mathers/Eminem personna, which is, after all, the slippery subject of all the art (is it enough to call it music?).

The tracks are still lyric-driven, but MM seems to be honing his own musical voice, and that means that his music is becoming distinguishable from the cookie-cutter gansta rap that has been, for him, merely a diving board.

He delves into his relationship with his mom, ouch, and Kim, and his daughter, and Dr. Dre. One of the highlights of the album is a song called Square Dance. It's a very poignant view point of America, and of Eminem's feelings\nabout his own life. Of course, the all the songs have his rhymes, and his rapping. I didn't notice any song that's, well, catchy like \"I Am\". But, why does a song need to be catchy?\nMaybe that's not how Eminem is feeling right now.", "summary": "Eminem's third, Successful again!", "unixReviewTime": 1022457600}

At first, I was very disappointed in how poorly of a fit the lid and container were. But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly.\n\nBeing a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.\n\nThe trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute:\n1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon.\n2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot.\n3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together.\n4. Allow to cool.\n5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers.\n\nDon't take my word for it though. Please only try one at first to make sure it works as well for you as it does for me.\n\nI hope this helps everyone purchasing this product.", "summary": "Lid too tight problem is fixable!", "unixReviewTime": 1294358400}

I ran it under hot water like someone mentioned to make it more pliable. And then put the lid on with a bit of difficulty. Then left it for 10 min. Came back and removed the lid with ease and put it back on very easily. So I would say when you get them and wash them, be sure to use hot water from the tap and then put lids on then.

My plan was to carry them back and forth between work and home (on public transportation) so I needed something that would be small, light, and unbreakable.  I had tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tupperware-Midget-Salt-Pepper-Shaker-NEW-Rare-Purple/dp/B008C4QVDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tupperware Midget Salt & Pepper Shaker NEW Rare Purple</a>, but found that the 2-ounce size of the container was too big, and that it took up too much room at the office and in my tote bag.  This smaller, 1-ounce size was much better for meeting my needs.\n\nLuckily, Tupperware makes their products so that the same size lids will sometimes work on similar containers, depending on the size of the lip of the container.  These two products looked like the lids would be interchangeable, so I took a chance and placed the order.  I'm happy to report the shaker part of the original set I bought fits perfectly onto this container.  By the way, the salt and pepper lids work on this set, too:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tupperware-Smidget-Container-1oz-Each-Assorted-Set-5/dp/B001E3DMXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tupperware Smidget Container 1oz Each Assorted Set 5</a>&nbsp;I have been hunting for a good set of portable salt and pepper shakers for years. By combining these two products, the mission was accomplished!  Note - I plan to re-post this review, with minor variations, on these two other product pages, so if you see it over there, you won't need to re-read the details.\n\nAny Tupperware container with a round lid is leak proof, so you can fill them up with small quantities of shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc., and take them on the road, without worrying about leaks.  I have NEVER had a problem with a leak from a Tupperware container with a round lip.  As an added bonus, the containers have a lot of uses.  You can use them to keep your spices fresh.  My mom used to use them to store Wilton icing coloring dyes. They would be good for small quantities of craft products.  They are perfect for maintaining order over the small things that get thrown into a junk drawer.  These things are handy, so this list could go on and on.\n\nFrom my experience with Tupperware, sometimes the lids are a bit tight-fitting when they are new.  If you soak the lid in hot water for a couple of minutes, it will expand slightly, and will easily fit onto the container.  You should only need to do this one or two times; after that, they should fit without pre-soaking.\n\nColor - 2 stars\n\nThe color is ugly, and I would not call it pink.  It is more of a watered-down version of a coral-like (or maybe salmon-like) tint than pink.  When I saw the color on the computer screen, I thought the color difference between my idea of pink and the reality would be chalked up to the virtual world.  But the reality was worse than the monitor.  :p  Saying this color is \"pink\" isn't even as accurate as saying that \"aquamarine\" is \"green\" or \"blue.\"  I'm glad I didn't plan to keep these out on the table.\n\nValue Analysis - 3 stars\n\nIn the past, it was always been worth paying a little extra for Tupperware because of the superior quality of the Tupperware brand, as well as the lifetime guarantee.  With this order, however, I noticed that the plastic feels slightly thinner and more brittle than the Tupperware containers I bought 20 years ago.  I actually took some of the older containers out and did a side-by-side comparison, and I liked the older ones better.  I'm afraid the containers may not be as durable as they used to be, but they still seem to be very durable.  Tupperware is still superior to most plastics, but the quality of Rubbermaid has improved over the years, and Rubbermaid is much less expensive.  If my Rubbermaid fails, I just throw it out and buy a new one.\n\nWhen I have used the warranty, it has provided a needed replacement for a favorite piece of plastic, and I've been very pleased with the results.  Balance this against the fact that, if I want to return a Tupperware product that fails, I have to pay shipping to send it back to them.  This is often just as expensive as the cost of the item being replaced.  I also have to pay shipping and handling for them to send the replacement back to me.  According to their web site, this is currently (May 2013) a flat rate of $5.75.  (And this assumes that the item can still be replaced, and you don't end up with a substitute.  You may wind up with a replacement of a different color, so the set you have no longer matches.)  I have a few pieces of Tupperware that need to be replaced, but have decided it's just not economical to do so.  So the pieces sit there in the back of the closet while I wait for the pile to grow large enough to make it worth the cost of sending them in and getting them replaced.  I have tried to convince myself to just throw them out, but they don't take up much room. ;)\n\nIs Tupperware worth the extra cost?  Yes, but only for especially useful and/or unique pieces.  Personally, I'm planning to seek out this brand only if nothing else will meet the need I have.", "summary": "Is Tupperware Worth the Cost?", "unixReviewTime": 1367712000}

At first, I was very disappointed in how poorly of a fit the lid and container were. But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly.\n\nBeing a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.\n\nThe trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute:\n1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon.\n2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot.\n3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together.\n4. Allow to cool.\n5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers.\n\nDon't take my word for it though.

This is the second of this exact model of paper towel holder that I have owned, and I bought this as a replacement for the first one. I had the first one for about eight years, and it finally broke, requiring replacement.\nThe thing I like about this specific towel holder is the design (wall or under cabinet mounting is at your option) which allows the roll to be slipped onto the central retaining spindle without requiring support at both ends, making for a secure towel holder that will not allow the roll of towels to fly out of the holder which is common in some holders which retain the towel roll by pressure on opposite ends of the roll. Another nice feature of this holder is the slightly upturned end of the roll retaining bar to prevent the roll from slipping off the rod when towels are aggressively pulled off the roll, especially with one handed operation. Overall this has been a great paper towel holder.\nI gave this holder four stars for one reason only, which is that being exclusively plastic it is vulnerable to fatigue cracking of the mounting cylinder, which requires replacement of the unit. This is exactly what finished off my old unit (it cracked at the attachment flange area and was not repairable.)

User friendliness gets 5 stars. Just removing the heater from the box, rip all the plastics off and plug it in. I set it in the 17' x 20' living room where it leads to open kitchen, hall way and the stair case. I wanted a heater I could use before I officially turn on the centralized heater which blasts through the entire house. This heater does the job. There is no annoying sound, no burning odor at the first time plugging it in as some previous posts suggested, I keep it on lower heat and never leave it on unattended ... meaning that the unit is ON when I am in the room where I could see it. I have 4 cats and I don't take any chance with any appliances whatsoever. Would my cats ever decide to jump or lean on it to cause it to tip and fall on the floor? Maybe. As far as I know, the unit has auto timer but not auto-shut off feature when and if it tips over. If you are looking for a heater with such feature to shut-off automatically as some other units being sold at much higher price, obviously this one is not for you. It all depends on what you are looking for in terms of buying a space heater. My budget to be spent for a heater was no more than $60 and I am glad I bought this Lasko model 5160. As soon as you turn it on, it starts disbursing warm air out but the enclosure seems to stay cool to touch.

At first, I was very disappointed in how poorly of a fit the lid and container were. But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly.\n\nBeing a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.\n\nThe trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute:\n1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon.\n2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot.\n3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together.\n4. Allow to cool.\n5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers.\n\nDon't take my word for it though. Please only try one at first to make sure it works as well for you as it does for me.\n\nI hope this helps everyone purchasing this product.", "summary": "Lid too tight problem is fixable!", "unixReviewTime": 1294358400}

Use the supplied Allen wrench to loosen the tiny nuts on the left fixture. Insert the wire. Tighten the tiny nuts onto the wire.  Stretch the wire until it'll fit into the right fixture with no slack. Having a friend helps here, but isn't necessary. Loosen the nuts on the right side, insert the wire, and tighten the tiny nuts again. Now hold the left cylinder so it doesn't turn, and turn the middle cylinder to take up the slack! Seriously- they sometimes don't come with instructions. The \"wire\" is actually a thin, braided cable, so wire cutters are necessary to keep the ends from fraying.

One tip, if you are using this for a window that is bigger than 1 window wide, get the center support.  It really did make a difference.  Also, try to put them into a stud.  We installed with anchors originally, and they started to pull out pretty quickly.  I really wanted them further out from the window sides, but the curtains pulling out of the wall looked terrible.

This system was VERY easy to install, but you do have to provide your own screws. You'd want to anyway to match them to the material to which you are mounting. For me that was wood, so it was easy. I was skeptical trusting IKEA (yeah, I have or have had some of their furniture) with the tensioning mechanism, but it is really solid and very easy to use. Make sure you have good wire snips and as the pictographs in the directions imply, don't try and use scissors to cut the wire as the cut end will need to be inserted into a whole that is just the right size and if you mess the cut up it will be VERY hard to insert. My first cut was with some cheap snips and I had to make another cut with better snips that cut more clean.\n\nThe installed product looks good and is very sturdy.", "summary": "I was wary as it's an IKEA product, but no longer!", "unixReviewTime": 1378339200}
